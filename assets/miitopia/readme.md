# NO!

## If you must miitopia over everything

1. Go to [sitting on clouds](https://www.sittingonclouds.net/album/1287) or something and get the soundtrack.
2. Make sure `FFMPEG` is installed and is in your `PATH`.
3. put the audio files inside the `soundtrack` directory.


Should look something like this.
